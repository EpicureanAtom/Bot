The r/ministryofredditing has already investigated. 

It's porn of a fictional Lego(?) character that is confirmed to be 11. 

We're still determining the best course of action for this one since we're unsure what Reddit TOS moderators will think about it since the character isn't human and it's also drawn images (which they're more lax on). 

Redditors below 18  do not enter. Redditors above 18 or 18  enter if you want  but I don't advise it.

Either way  this argument about it "frying your brain" is nonsense. Supposedly  tube TVs did that and video games and everything else under the sun.

1naypkv,r/ofcoursethatsasub,PSA: Brigading,Hi. I'm not a moderator here but most of you probably already know who I am and know about the r/ministryofredditing. Myself and the moderation team of the r/ministryofredditing are currently in touch with your subreddit's moderation team regarding some serious issues. 

Reddit TOS rule 2 states that entering a subreddit and making off topic posts  mass downvoting  vote manipulation  and a handful of other things including mass reporting of non-reportable subs is considered Harassment which is a bannable offense and a TOS violation. 

From the r/ministryofredditing  when you do these things  you make it much harder for us to do our part as well. Our subreddit has already come under fire multiple times for brigading because users here are entering our subreddit and encouraging this behavior. 

If you truly care about reddit...

KNOCK IT OFF

What you're doing when you get our subreddit involved is decreasing our credibility. You are actively hurting our mission when you do this and we've removed literal dozens of CSAM posts and subreddits in our short two weeks of being a subreddit. 

Right now  we're even getting interpol to launch an investigation that  if successful  will result in the arrest of a large number of predators numbering in the literal thousands across the world. 

We can't do that if you drag us into the mud. 

Make a post on our subreddit with the Concerned Redditor flair and we will launch our investigation. A lot of people assume that we just do this for clout but most of my karma doesn't come from the r/ministryofredditing but other subreddits I am directly involved in. I've actually lost karma since opening the r/ministryofredditing. 

If you truly want to help  for Christ's sake  please stop! Either join us or make Concerned Redditor posts.

1natwx2,r/ofcoursethatsasub,Kinda risky posting this tbh,I don't know the purpose of this server  the description is very vague and pretty creepy. Hopefully these people aren't actually attracted to little babies.

Ever since I made this post there has been people posting memes and hate to the owner in r/infantophilia. I understand that it is disgusting but please stop because it isn't helping anyone or anything. If anything it counts as harassment if the sub actually  ever does contain illegal content your posts and possibly you will be going down with it.​ This is borderline vigilante behavior.

Please stop.

The subreddit has no posts other than people ripping into the owner for their fetishes. It is impossible to know if there was a previous TOS violation.

Please keep in mind that the subreddit name does not inherently represent what the subreddit is actually about. 

r/worldpolitics and r/anime_titties would be proof of this. 

In any case  do not go into that subreddit with the intention of "letting them have it." That violates Rule 2 and is considered brigading. And yes  reddit can and will ban you for it even if the subreddit violates TOS. Many of our earliest Subdivers got bans for doing exactly this. 

In any case  I will make no assumptions about the content that might have been there before. If I can't see it  I can't do anything about it. 

When you find subreddits like these  please bring them to the r/ministryofredditing instead  and we will launch an investigation. So far  we have been directly responsible for the arrest of over 400 pedophiles and the dismantling of numerous pedophilic subreddits. 

WE

DO

NOT

CONDONE

HARASSMENT 


We have our doctrine the way we do because we give a shit about everyone and everything. Many of our Subdivers are already seeking counseling because of the things we find on reddit and many Subdivers are being permanently retired from Subdiving since they are  for lack of a better word  not cut out for it. 

FAQ:

1) Yes  we already report these things to the police. 

2) No  you make our job harder when you go in and harass these subreddits. You also make it mildly harder to get a conviction. Very mildly  but you are making it more difficult for us to remove dangerous people from society. 

3) No  we're not the porn police. We can't get a subreddit banned or people arrested just because you got an icky feeling looking at some content. 

4) No  we're not LARPers. Most of the Subdivers that do remain Subdivers are already prior military  law enforcement  EMS  or other professionals that already deal with this stuff. We're just volunteers.,1757259912,Subdiver Colonel u/Crabtickler9000 reporting back.
